## How To Use



Process Overview:

* Day 1:
  - Finding template
  - Identified multiple potential templates to uses
  - Narrowed choices down to three
  - Chose Colid-Colorlib because of simplicity (single page) and similarity to HackTJ Template
* Day 2:
  - Created Wireframe
      ![Wireframe Image](images/wireframe.PNG)
  - Altered template to fit basic structure of wireframe
* Day 3:
  - Added FAQs
  - Removed overlay from template and added aclrendering [cover image for landing page]
  - Deleted unused sections and gifs that greatly increased landing time
* Challenges
  - Loading time, especially for resources such as images and gifs
    - Used unusedcss.com to remove boilerplate css that was part of template, but was not used in final website
    - This introduced some challenges in itself because the unusedcss removed important code, such as the navbar
    - Overall useful; some small issues
* Slow Scrolling speed
  - Somewhat helped by
