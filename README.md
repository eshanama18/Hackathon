## Design Goals

* Simple, easy to navigate, information - based
  - Only necessary resources (images, etc) included
  - Minimal amount of text
  - Large, eye - catching buttons with clear purposes
* Smooth User Experience
  - CSS minimized
  - Resource size minimized
  - Javascript placed at bottom


## Process Overview


* Day 1:
  - Finding template
  - Identified multiple potential templates to uses
  - Narrowed choices down to three
  - Chose Colid-Colorlib because of simplicity (single page) and similarity to HackTJ Template
* Day 2:
  - Created Wireframe
  - Altered template to fit basic structure of wireframe
  - Wireframe

* Day 3:
  - Added FAQs
  - Removed overlay from template and added aclrendering [cover image for landing page]
  - Deleted unused sections and gifs that greatly increased landing time
* Challenges
  - Loading time, especially for resources such as images and gifs
    - Used unusedcss.com to remove boilerplate css that was part of template, but was not used in final website
    - This introduced some challenges in itself because the unusedcss removed important code, such as the navbar
    - Overall useful; some small issues
* Slow Scrolling speed
  - Somewhat helped by removing resources and optimizing CSS
