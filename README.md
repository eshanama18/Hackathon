## How To Use





-   Process Overview:

          -   Day 1:
              -   Finding Template
              -   Identified multiple potential templates to use
              -   Narrowed choices down to three
              -   Chose Colid-Colorlib because of simplicity (one page) and similarity to HackTJ Template
          -   Day 2:
              -   Created Wireframe
                  ![Wireframe Image](images/wireframe.PNG)
              -   Altered template to fit basic structure of wireframe
          -   Day 3:

              -   Added FAQs
              -   Removed overlay from template and added aclrendering [cover page] image
              -   Deleted unused sections and gifs that greatly increased loading time

          -   Significant Challenges
              -   Loading time, especially for resources such as images and gifs
                  -   Used unusedcss.com to remove boilerplate css that was part of template, but was not used in final website
                  -   This introduced some challenges in itself because the unusedcss removed important code, such as the navbar
                  -   Overall useful; some small issues
          -   Slow scrolling speed
              -   Somewhat helped by
